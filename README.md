<h3>What is <code>HEAD</code> in Git?</h3>

<p><code>HEAD</code> in Git is a <strong>pointer to your current commit</strong> â€“ it shows what you're currently "looking at" or where new commits will be added.</p>


<h3>What is Tracking?</h3>

<p>In Git, <strong>tracking</strong> refers to the established relationship between a local branch in your repository and a specific branch in a remote repository.</p>

<p>Think of it as setting up a <strong>default communication channel</strong> for a particular local branch. When a local branch "tracks" a remote branch (often called its "upstream branch"), Git gains several convenient automatic behaviors:</p>
 
<h4>1. Simplified `git pull`</h4>
<p>When you're on a tracking branch and type just <code>git pull</code>, Git automatically knows which remote to fetch from and which remote branch to merge into your current local branch. You don't need to specify <code>git pull origin main</code> every time if your local <code>main</code> branch is tracking <code>origin/main</code>.</p>

<h4>2. Simplified `git push`</h4>
<p>Similarly, if your local branch is tracking a remote branch, you can often just type <code>git push</code>, and Git will automatically push your commits to the corresponding remote branch.</p>

<h4>3. Status Information</h4>
<p><code>git status</code> provides helpful information about your local branch's relationship to its tracking branch. It will tell you if your local branch is:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>"ahead"</strong> (you have commits not yet pushed to the remote).</li>
    <li><strong>"behind"</strong> (the remote has commits you haven't pulled yet).</li>
    <li><strong>"diverged"</strong> (both you and the remote have unique commits).</li>
    <li><strong>"up to date."</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>How is tracking established?</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cloning a repository:</strong> When you <code>git clone</code> a repository, Git automatically sets up your local <code>main</code> (or <code>master</code>) branch to track <code>origin/main</code> (or <code>origin/master</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>Creating a new local branch from a remote branch:</strong> If you do <code>git checkout -b new-feature origin/new-feature</code>, your new <code>new-feature</code> branch will automatically track <code>origin/new-feature</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Manually setting/changing upstream:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>When pushing a new local branch for the first time: <code>git push -u origin my-new-branch</code> (<code>-u</code> is shorthand for <code>--set-upstream</code>).</li>
            <li>For an existing local branch: <code>git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/another-branch my-local-branch</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, tracking is about making your common Git operations (<code>pull</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>status</code>) more efficient and informative by pre-configuring the remote and remote branch your local branch is most closely associated with.</p>



<h3>What is <code>origin</code>?</h3>
<p><code>origin</code> is the default name Git gives to your remote repository (usually on GitHub). You can check it with:</p>

<pre><code>git remote -v</code></pre>
<p>Typical output:</p>
<pre><code>origin  git@github.com:yourname/post2video.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:yourname/post2video.git (push)
</code></pre>

<p><code>origin</code> is a property of the repository</p>

<h4>How to check origin</h4>

```bash
git remote -v
```

```bash
git remote show origin
```

<h3>What is upstream?</h3>
Upstream in Git is the primary remote repository or branch that your local repository pulls updates from and/or pushes your contributions towards. 
<p>Upstream is a property of a local branch</p>

<h4>How to check upstream</h4>

```bash
git branch -vv
```

<h3>Why <code>origin</code> is Critically Important in Git</h3>

<p>'<strong>origin</strong>' is a fundamental concept in Git, serving as the default and most common name for your <strong>main remote repository</strong>. It's not a branch, but rather an <strong>alias</strong> (a friendly nickname) that points to the web address (URL) of your project's primary shared code location, typically hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.</p>

<p>Understanding <code>origin</code> is key to effective version control and collaboration. Here's why it's so important:</p>

<h4>1. The Bridge to Collaboration</h4>
<p><code>origin</code> acts as the central hub for team collaboration. Without it, your local work would be isolated.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Receiving Teammates' Changes:</strong> When others push their work to the shared remote, you use commands like `git pull origin main` or `git fetch origin` to download those updates to your local repository. <code>origin</code> tells Git *where* to look for these changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing Your Work:</strong> Once you've committed your own changes locally, you use <code>origin</code> to upload them for others to see and integrate. For example, `git push origin my-feature-branch` tells Git to send your local 'my-feature-branch' to the remote repository named <code>origin</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Your Project's Central Source of Truth</h4>
<p>In most development workflows, <code>origin</code> represents the authoritative, shared version of the codebase. It's where all integrated work resides and where team members synchronize their efforts.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It ensures everyone is working from the same foundation, minimizing conflicts and maintaining consistency across the project.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Essential for Backup and Disaster Recovery</h4>
<p>Your local repository is on your machine, but <code>origin</code> provides a critical off-site backup. If your local drive fails or becomes corrupted, your entire project history and code are safe on <code>origin</code>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can easily clone the repository again from <code>origin</code> to restore your working environment: `git clone https://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo.git` (which implicitly sets up <code>origin</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Streamlines Commands and Workflow</h4>
<p>Using <code>origin</code> as a shorthand makes Git commands more concise and intuitive.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Instead of typing the full URL (e.g., `git pull https://github.com/NathanKr/git-tracking-basics main`), you simply type `git pull origin main`. This saves time and reduces errors.</li>
    <li>It creates a consistent mental model for how local and remote repositories interact.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Analogy: Your Local Workspace vs. The Shared Company Drive</h4>
  <p>Imagine your local computer's project folder is your personal desk workspace. You're working on a document there.</p>
  <p>'<strong>origin</strong>' is like the central, shared company drive (or a cloud service like Google Drive) where the master version of the document is stored, and where everyone else on your team collaborates.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>When you `git pull origin main`, you're going to the shared drive (<code>origin</code>), getting the latest 'main' document, and bringing it to your desk.</li>
      <li>When you `git push origin my-feature-branch`, you're taking your 'my-feature-branch' document from your desk and uploading it to the shared drive (<code>origin</code>) for everyone else to see.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Without the shared drive (<code>origin</code>), you couldn't easily collaborate or back up your work.</p>

<p>In essence, <code>origin</code> is the lifeline connecting your individual contributions to the collective project, enabling teamwork, ensuring data integrity, and simplifying your daily Git operations.</p>


<h2>Design - Branching Strategy</h2>
<p>
  This strategy uses a <b><code>dev</code> &rarr; <code>preview</code> &rarr; <code>main</code></b> flow, establishing clear stages for code stability: <code>dev</code> for active work, <code>preview</code> for testing and QA, and <code>main</code> for production.
</p>
<p>
  It <b>reduces the risk of bugs</b> in live environments by requiring code to pass through validation points. While it adds some merging overhead and branch management compared to simpler models, it's excellent for projects needing <b>structured quality control and predictable releases</b>.
</p>

<h3>Flow</h3>
<p><code>dev</code> &rarr; <code>preview</code> &rarr; <code>main</code></p>

<h3>Upstream Configuration (One-Time Setup)</h3>
<p>To enable simple <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> commands without specifying <code>origin</code> or branch names, ensure your local branches are tracking their corresponding remote branches. This is the standard way Git simplifies interactions with the remote.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>dev</code> local branch should track <code>origin/dev</code>.
        <pre><code>git checkout dev
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev dev
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><code>preview</code> local branch should track <code>origin/preview</code>.
        <pre><code>git checkout preview
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/preview preview
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><code>main</code> local branch should track <code>origin/main</code>. (This is often set by default when cloning, no <code>set-upstream</code> typically needed
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <em>You can verify tracking status for all your local branches with: <code>git branch -vv</code></em>
</p>

<h3>Merging and Pushing Workflow</h3>
<p>This is how you promote changes from one stage to the next. You merge the source branch into the target branch, then push the <i>target</i> branch to its corresponding remote.</p>

<h4>1. Promote from <code>dev</code> to <code>preview</code></h4>
<p>This process brings the latest changes from <code>dev</code> into the <code>preview</code> branch, ready for testing in the <code>preview</code> environment.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout preview    # Switch to the target branch (preview)
git pull                # Get the latest changes from origin/preview
git merge dev           # Merge changes from the dev branch into preview
# Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
git push                # Push the updated preview branch to origin/preview
</code></pre>

<h4>2. Promote from <code>preview</code> to <code>main</code></h4>
<p>Once changes in <code>preview</code> are stable and approved, this process brings them into the <code>main</code> branch for production deployment.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout main       # Switch to the target branch (main)
git pull                # Get the latest changes from origin/main
git merge preview       # Merge changes from the preview branch into main
# Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
git push                # Push the updated main branch to origin/main
</code></pre>



<h2>Demo</h2>

<h3>branch created<h3>

dev :
<img src='./figs/create-dev-branch.png'/>

preview :
<img src='./figs/create-preview-branch.png'/>


<h3>show upstream</h3>

You can see here that only main branch has upstream which is origin/main
<img src='./figs/show-branch-upstream.png'/>

This means that on main you can do 

```bash
git pull
git push
```

and git will know where to look for the info i.e. origin/main


<h3>create upstream</h3>
       
The following create upstream for dev

<img src='./figs/set-dev-upstream-for-dev.png'/>

The following create upstream for preview

<img src='./figs/set-preview-upstream-for-preview.png'/>

now all branched has upstream 

<img src='./figs/all-branch-has-upstream.png'/>
